Practical 10: DoS USING COLASOFT

Aim : DoS using ColaSoft by flooding the destination with

data packets.

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal
network traffic by overwhelming a targeted system with traffic, making it
unavailable to legitimate users. Essentially, the attacker floods the system
with so much traffic that it can't handle the legitimate requests, causing the
service to slow down or crash.
