Aim: Use Wireshark (Sniffer) to capture network traffic and analyze and thus check vulnerability of network systems.

1.Inspect traffic for a specific IP address.
Filter : ip.addr==192.168.3.35 (any ipv4)

2. Search: techpanda.com (on google) (then filter)
http:
 
4. http.referer contains " http://neverssl.com" (used this link but it changed into http://wholesoothinginnerday.neverssl.com/online/)
 
5. Find out packets which are getting the response as PAGE NOT FOUND.
URL used : http://info.cern.ch/authentication
Filter : http.response.code==404

6. Find out those packets which are getting responses.
Filter : http.response.code==200
 
7. Find Packets-: Browser Specific.
Filter : http.user_agent contains Firefox
Bowser Search: (Search in firefox only to get output) www.google.com and then http //jiofi.local.html

8. Codes for server.py and client.py:

server.py: 
import socket

s = socket.socket()
print("Socket created successfully!")

port=8080
s.bind(('localhost'. port))
print("Socket binded to %s" % port)

while True:
  c, addr = s.accept()
  print("Got connection from", addr)
  c.sendall('Thank you for connecting!'.encode())
  c.close()


client.py:
import socket

s=socket.socket()
port=8080
s.connect(('localhost',port))
print(s.recv(1024).decode())

1st run server.py, 2nd client.py in 2 different cmd.

9.To sniff communication between client and server
Filter :tcp.server==1
