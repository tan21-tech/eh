Prep (before Cain):
Install WinPcap or Npcap (required for packet capture).
Run Cain & Abel as Administrator (right‑click → Run as admin).
Make sure you’re on the same LAN as the targets (same subnet) and disable VPN if active.
Use a lab network or get written permission before testing.

Sniffing steps in Cain & Abel:
Open Cain & Abel → go to the Sniffer tab (icon looks like a network plug).

Click Configure (or Options) inside Sniffer and select the correct network adapter (the interface connected to the LAN).

Click Start Sniffer (or the Start/Play button). Cain will begin listening on the selected adapter in promiscuous mode.

Click Scan MAC Addresses (or press the Scan button) — Cain will populate a list of live hosts on the LAN (IP, MAC, hostname).

To passively capture traffic: select a host or leave all hosts selected — Cain displays captured sessions in the lower pane (protocol, source, destination).

To capture credentials from cleartext protocols (HTTP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SMB, etc.) Cain will show decoded logins automatically in the Passwords/Decoded Data area as traffic is observed.

To actively intercept traffic (ARP poisoning / MITM) — use APR (ARP Poison Routing):

Go to the APR tab.

Click NetBIOS/ARP scan (or simply Scan).

Select the target IP(s) (victim) and the gateway/router IP.

Click Start APR (or Poison). Cain will ARP-poison the target(s) to redirect their traffic through your machine — you’ll then see more intercepted sessions.

Monitor the Sniffer and Passwords panes for captured credentials and data.

Export/save results: Right-click captured entries → Save/Export to export sessions or decoded passwords for reporting.

When done, Stop APR (if used) and Stop Sniffer. Clear any poisoning and re-enable normal network operations.
